# Python_Group3
This repository was made to store the files made by the members of Group 3 under the course SMJE 4383 (Advanced Programming). The files were uploaded as part of classwork or the assignment to develop an online bookstore.

âœ¨ For Assignment 1:
i) Download the files **Bookstore_class.py**, **book_names.txt** and **author_names.txt** to your computer.
ii) Make sure the downloaded files are copied/saved to **the same folder** in your computer.
iii) Open the file Bookstore_class.py and run the code using your local IDE (e.g. Microsoft VSCode, Pycharm etc)
