# Python_Group3
This repository was made to store the files made by the members of Group 3 under the course SMJE 4383 (Advanced Programming). The files were uploaded as part of classwork or the assignment to develop an online bookstore.  
  
✨ Running the **offline** program:  
i) Download the files **BookHeaven.py**, **books.txt** and **author_names.txt** and the folder **book_cover** to your computer.  
ii) Make sure the downloaded files are copied/saved to **the same folder** in your computer.  
iii) Open the file Bookstore_class.py using your local IDE (e.g. Microsoft VSCode, Pycharm etc).  
iv) Change the path on line 59 of the code to the path you have copied the book_cover folder to. You may also need to install the Pillow library to make the program show you pictures. Just open the terminal, type "#pip install pillow" and hit enter.  
v) Run the code using your local IDE.
